Features are additional geometric operations on :code:`Beams`:



* **Trim Feature** cuts a beam with a :code:`Plane`. The part of the beam lying on the *z-positive* side of the plane will be removed.

* **Brep Subtraction Feature** is a boolean operation to subtract any *Brep* geometry from a beam.
